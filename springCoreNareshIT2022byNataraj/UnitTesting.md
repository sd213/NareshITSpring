# is unit testing is not good with inheritance


## Unit testing can be **challenging** when inheritance is involved, but it is not necessarily "bad." However, certain factors associated with inheritance can make unit testing harder and less reliable if not properly managed.

Let's explore why inheritance can complicate unit testing and how to address these challenges.

### **Challenges of Unit Testing with Inheritance**

1. **Tight Coupling Between Classes**:
   - When a subclass is tightly coupled to its parent class, changes in the parent class can affect the behavior of the subclass.
   - This tight coupling makes it difficult to isolate the subclass during unit testing because the subclass might depend on the implementation of methods from the parent class.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   class Animal {
       public void sound() {
           System.out.println("Animal sound");
       }
   }

   class Dog extends Animal {
       @Override
       public void sound() {
           System.out.println("Dog barks");
       }
   }
   ```

   **Issue**: When unit testing the `Dog` class, you are also implicitly testing the behavior inherited from the `Animal` class.

   **Solution**: Use **mocking frameworks** like Mockito or PowerMock to mock the parent class's behavior and test the subclass independently.

   ```java
   @Test
   public void testDogSound() {
       Dog dog = new Dog();
       assertEquals("Dog barks", dog.sound());
   }
   ```

2. **Hidden or Overridden Behavior**:
   - If a subclass overrides methods from the parent class, unit testing may miss bugs in the overridden behavior.
   - Testing only the subclass without testing how it interacts with the parent class can lead to missed edge cases.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   class Vehicle {
       public void move() {
           System.out.println("Vehicle is moving");
       }
   }

   class Car extends Vehicle {
       @Override
       public void move() {
           System.out.println("Car is moving");
       }
   }
   ```

   **Issue**: If `Car` overrides `move()`, but a bug exists in the parent's `move()` method, this may not be detected unless the parent class is also tested.

   **Solution**: Write unit tests for both the parent class (`Vehicle`) and the subclass (`Car`) to ensure that the overridden method doesn't break behavior.

3. **Complex Hierarchies**:
   - Deep inheritance hierarchies make it difficult to track which class is responsible for specific behavior.
   - Testing each class in isolation becomes more complex when the behavior of a class depends on multiple layers of inheritance.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   class A {
       public void doSomething() { System.out.println("A does something"); }
   }

   class B extends A {
       @Override
       public void doSomething() { System.out.println("B does something"); }
   }

   class C extends B {
       @Override
       public void doSomething() { System.out.println("C does something"); }
   }
   ```

   **Issue**: Testing class `C` becomes tricky because its behavior depends on both `B` and `A`.

   **Solution**: Test each class in the hierarchy separately to ensure that behavior is maintained at each level of the hierarchy.

4. **Violation of the Single Responsibility Principle**:
   - Inheritance can lead to classes that have multiple responsibilities because the subclass may inherit methods that it doesn't directly need or use.
   - This makes unit testing difficult because the subclass is not cohesive, making it hard to isolate individual behaviors.

   **Solution**: Use **composition** instead of inheritance where possible. If a class does not need to inherit behavior from a parent class, refactor it to use composition. This simplifies both the code and its unit tests.

### **Unit Testing Best Practices with Inheritance**

1. **Test Each Class in Isolation**:
   - Write unit tests for both the parent class and the subclass.
   - Ensure that changes in the parent class do not unintentionally break the behavior of the subclass.

2. **Use Mocking**:
   - Use mocking to isolate the behavior of the subclass from the parent class.
   - This ensures that tests for the subclass are not affected by the implementation of the parent class.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   @Mock
   private Vehicle mockVehicle;

   @Test
   public void testCarMove() {
       Car car = new Car();
       car.move();
       // Verify car's move() method without testing Vehicle
   }
   ```

3. **Write Tests for Overridden Methods**:
   - If a subclass overrides methods from the parent class, write tests specifically for the overridden behavior.
   - Ensure that the subclass maintains the expected behavior.

4. **Test Superclass Behavior**:
   - When testing a subclass, ensure that you also test the behavior inherited from the parent class.
   - Use test cases to verify that inherited methods still function as expected.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   @Test
   public void testInheritedBehavior() {
       Dog dog = new Dog();
       assertEquals("Animal sound", dog.sound()); // Inherited method from Animal
   }
   ```

5. **Avoid Deep Inheritance Hierarchies**:
   - If your class hierarchy is too deep, refactor the design to use composition instead of inheritance.
   - Deep hierarchies make testing more difficult and lead to fragile code.

6. **Favor Composition Over Inheritance**:
   - **Composition** is generally easier to test because you can mock the composed objects rather than dealing with complex inheritance hierarchies.
   - With composition, each object has a single responsibility, making unit testing simpler.

   **Example (Composition)**:
   ```java
   class Engine {
       public void start() { System.out.println("Engine starts"); }
   }

   class Car {
       private Engine engine;

       public Car(Engine engine) {
           this.engine = engine;
       }

       public void drive() {
           engine.start();
           System.out.println("Car is driving");
       }
   }
   ```

   **Unit Testing**:
   ```java
   @Test
   public void testCarWithMockEngine() {
       Engine mockEngine = Mockito.mock(Engine.class);
       Car car = new Car(mockEngine);
       car.drive();
       verify(mockEngine).start();  // Verify engine behavior
   }
   ```

### **Conclusion**

Unit testing with inheritance is not inherently "bad," but it can introduce complexities:
- Tight coupling between classes.
- Overridden or hidden behavior.
- Deep hierarchies complicating tests.
- Violations of principles like SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).

To manage these challenges, **mock dependencies** where necessary, ensure both parent and child classes are **individually tested**, and favor **composition over inheritance** when possible. This will result in more maintainable and testable code.
